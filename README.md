## Why style via a bower component?

So that other apps can serve the barrier. See FastFT and the inline barrier when trying to read more content.

Other apps can fetch `ft.com/products?fragment=true` to get a HTML fragment version of the barrier and import the styles via this component so that they have the supporting CSS.
